# snoerenberg/pi-cross-compile (Dockerfile)

A Dockerfile to allow cross-compiling C/C++ projects in Ubuntu that will run on a Raspberry Pi.

* * *

## Usage

Note that these instructions were written for a Mac.

To use this container you must pass it a local path that contains a __Makefile__ and a project to compile. In the example below, substitute __~/MY-PROJECTS/MY-BUILD__ with a path to your local project. Your folder must contain a valid make file called __Makefile__. The make file must contain references to the Raspberry Pi specific tools that will be described below.

    docker run -it -v ~/MY-PROJECTS/MY-BUILD:/build snoerenberg/pi-cross-compile
    
* * *
    
### Example

If you had a root project folder called __~/raspberry__ and a child folder containing your make file and source code called __hello__ you would compile it for Raspberry Pi like this:

    docker run -it -v ~/raspberry/hello:/build snoerenberg/pi-cross-compile
    
During the build process, output should be displayed in the terminal. On success, the container will exit and an executable that works on the Pi should be left in your local build directory.

You can find an example project here:

* [bitbucket.org/mitchallen/pi-hello-cross-compile.git](https://bitbucket.org/mitchallen/pi-hello-cross-compile.git)
* [github.com/mitchallen/pi-hello-cross-compile.git](https://github.com/mitchallen/pi-hello-cross-compile.git)

To use the example project do the following:

    mkdir ~/raspberry

    cd ~/raspberry

    git clone https://github.com/mitchallen/pi-hello-cross-compile.git --depth=1 hello

    docker run -it -v ~/raspberry/hello:/build mitchallen/pi-cross-compile
  
On success an executable that only runs on the Raspberry Pi should be found here: __~/raspberry/hello/bin/hello__. It's up to you to figure out how to get it on your Pi to run it.

## Tools

This image contains a call to download Raspberry Cross Compile tools that can be found here: [https://github.com/raspberrypi/tools.git](https://github.com/raspberrypi/tools.git). It places them in a folder called __pitools__.

The actual line is this:

    git clone --progress --verbose https://github.com/raspberrypi/tools.git --depth=1 pitools

To cross compile using __gcc__ for Raspberry Pi you would need a line like this in your Makefile:

    CC=/pitools/arm-bcm2708/gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabihf-raspbian-x64/bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc

For other tools in that folder, browse [here](https://github.com/raspberrypi/tools/tree/master/arm-bcm2708/gcc-linaro-arm-linux-gnueabihf-raspbian-x64/bin).

## Running on Pi

Once your build is complete, the executable will not work on Ubuntu or a Mac. It will be up to you to copy it over to your Pi and test it.
